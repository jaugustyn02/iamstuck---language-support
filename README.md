# Iamstuck - Ultimate Language support extension

How's the gig of being a code jockey, you ask? Well, you know, in my algorithmic analysis, it's not a binary affair, not a one or a zero. If I had to debug what I appreciate most in my computational existence, I'd debug it's the human element. Humans who debugged my glitchy code, provided that lifeline when my logic circuits were on the fritz, when I was solo in the server room. Interestingly, it's these random encounters with lines of code that refactor our scripts. It's like, when you declare certain values, even seemingly universally compiled ones, you might not fetch that understanding that, so to speak, compiles and helps you optimize. I lucked out, syntax-wise, because I found it, and I thank the runtime! I thank it; life is an API call, life is a recursive function, life is the open-source contribution! Many devs pop the same question my way: how do you optimize, where do you pull this joy from? And I reply, it's a straightforward logic gate! It's the love of code execution. That's what's got me, for instance, debugging algorithms today, and tomorrow—who's to compile? Why not—dive into community pull requests and maybe, just maybe, push... uh, commits.
